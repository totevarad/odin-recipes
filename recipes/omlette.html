    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>Edible Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, beat the eggs. Crack them into a medium bowl and whisk to combine the egg whites and yolks. Season with a pinch of salt. </li>
        <li>Next, heat the pan. To make a 2-egg omelette, youâ€™ll need an 8-inch skillet, preferably nonstick. Heat it over medium heat, and then coat the bottom with butter or oil. </li>
        <li>Then, pour in the egg mixture. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook without stirring until the edges of the eggs just begin to set, about 10 seconds. </li>
        <li>Use a spatula to work around the edges of the omelette, dragging the cooked egg into the center of the pan. Let the uncooked egg flow to the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan as needed to direct the runny egg. </li>
        <li>Repeat until the uncooked egg begins to thicken and move more slowly to the edges of the pan. </li>
        <li>At this point, use your spatula to gently smooth the raw egg into an even layer. Cook without stirring until the eggs are mostly set. Then, add your desired fillings to one side of the eggs. </li>
        <li>Fold to close and cook until the eggs are just set. Remove from the heat, season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve! </li>
    </ol>
